      Mintlify is a developer documentation platform that helps product and
      engineering teams create, maintain, and host modern docs. It uses a
      docs‑as‑code workflow (Markdown in your repo) with a rich component
      library and GitHub integration. Mintlify can generate polished API
      references from OpenAPI/Swagger or Postman, add interactive “Try it”
      requests and dynamic code samples/SDKs, and includes AI tools (like its
      Doc Writer) to draft and update docs from your code. It provides fast,
      branded sites with search, versioning, changelogs, analytics, and
      collaboration features, so teams can ship documentation as quickly as they
      ship code.

  Mintlify is an AI-native intelligent documentation platform designed for the
  next generation of technical documentation, combining beautiful out-of-the-box
  design with advanced collaboration and AI capabilities. The platform
  integrates AI throughout the entire documentation lifecycle—from writing and
  maintenance to how content is understood by both human users and LLMs—with
  features like a context-aware agent for self-updating knowledge management,
  intelligent AI assistants that turn documentation visits into guided
  conversations, and native support for llms.txt and MCP to ensure products
  appear in AI workflows.
